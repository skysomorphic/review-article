	abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate that finite linear combinations of compositions of a fixed, univariate function and a set of affine functionals can uniformly approximate any continuous function ofn real variables with support in the unit hypercube; only mild conditions are imposed on the univariate function. Our results settle an open question about representability in the class of single hidden layer neural networks. In particular, we show that arbitrary decision regions can be arbitrarily well approximated by continuous feedforward neural networks with only a single internal, hidden layer and any continuous sigmoidal nonlinearity. The paper discusses approximation properties of other possible types of nonlinearities that might be implemented by artificial neural networks.},

	abstract = {The classical Universal Approximation Theorem holds for neural networks of arbitrary width and bounded depth. Here we consider the natural ‘dual’ scenario for networks of bounded width and arbitrary depth. Precisely, let n be the number of inputs neurons, m be the number of output neurons, and let ρ be any nonaffine continuous function, with a continuous nonzero derivative at some point. Then we show that the class of neural networks of arbitrary depth, width n + m + 2, and activation function ρ, is dense in C(K; {\textbackslash}{mathbbR}{\textasciicircum}m) for K {\textbackslash}subseteq {\textbackslash}{mathbbR}{\textasciicircum}n with K compact. This covers every activation function possible to use in practice, and also includes polynomial activation functions, which is unlike the classical version of the theorem, and provides a qualitative difference between deep narrow networks and shallow wide networks. We then consider several extensions of this result. In particular we consider nowhere differentiable activation functions, density in noncompact domains with respect to the L{\textasciicircum}p-norm, and how the width may be reduced to just n + m + 1 for ‘most’ activation functions.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A significant challenge for the control of a robotic lower extremity rehabilitation exoskeleton is to ensure stability and robustness during programmed tasks or motions, which is crucial for the safety of the mobility-impaired user. Due to various levels of the user’s disability, the human-exoskeleton interaction forces and external perturbations are unpredictable and could vary substantially and cause conventional motion controllers to behave unreliably or the robot to fall down. In this work, we propose a new, reinforcement learning-based, motion controller for a lower extremity rehabilitation exoskeleton, aiming to perform collaborative squatting exercises with efficiency, stability, and strong robustness. Unlike most existing rehabilitation exoskeletons, our exoskeleton has ankle actuation on both sagittal and front planes and is equipped with multiple foot force sensors to estimate center of pressure ({CoP}), an important indicator of system balance. This proposed motion controller takes advantage of the {CoP} information by incorporating it in the state input of the control policy network and adding it to the reward during the learning to maintain a well balanced system state during motions. In addition, we use dynamics randomization and adversary force perturbations including large human interaction forces during the training to further improve control robustness. To evaluate the effectiveness of the learning controller, we conduct numerical experiments with different settings to demonstrate its remarkable ability on controlling the exoskeleton to repetitively perform well balanced and robust squatting motions under strong perturbations and realistic human interaction forces.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, their development and broad dissemination are limited by the requirement for lengthy human tests and handcrafted control laws2. Here we show an experiment-free method to learn a versatile control policy in simulation. Our learning-in-simulation framework leverages dynamics-aware musculoskeletal and exoskeleton models and data-driven reinforcement learning to bridge the gap between simulation and reality without human experiments. The learned controller is deployed on a custom hip exoskeleton that automatically generates assistance across different activities with reduced metabolic rates by 24.3\%, 13.1\% and 15.4\% for walking, running and stair climbing, respectively. Our framework may offer a generalizable and scalable strategy for the rapid development and widespread adoption of a variety of assistive robots for both able-bodied and mobility-impaired individuals.},
